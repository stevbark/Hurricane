This is a game project I worked with 4 other students on. We started by downloading an example online which made the basis of the game;
afterwards I implemented the items and effects into the game (found in the item folder in the src folder). I did this by creating a template which individual elements would implement.
I decided to do this so that all the different items and effects would have the same methods and allow me to easily update the base behaviors.
